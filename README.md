### Project Requirements

Image Gallery Page
1) **Search Capabilities**
  - The user should have the ability to enter text into a search field and see images that match the entered text.
  - Assume that the input will run against all photo object values for simplicities sake. 
2) **Image Grid**
  - Images will default appear as thumbnails on iteratable pages
3) **Modal Behavior**
  - On clicking an image on in image grid, a modal will appear displaying stored metadata 
  - Via wireframe, **editable fields** within the image are 
    - **Title**
    - **Description**
    - **Public Domain?** 
  - Clicking **Save** on the modal window will persist changes onto the JSON
  - Clicking **Cancel** on the modal window will persist changes onto the JSON 
  - Let's also assume that **pressing "X" or closing out of the window** on clicking an area outside will **cancel changes** as well 
5) **Pagination**
  - < > Arrows will increase/decrease page by one 
  - << >> Arrows will set the current page either to the first or last 

6) Additional Features if Time Allots 
  - Choose amount of images that appear on each page
